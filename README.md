CybriaGG was the first to make a good Now.gg repo that wouldn't be detected via proxy, so I forked it and used it like a lot of other people.
At some point I realized that the creator of that repo archived it, and the repo wasn't working as usual.
I added a bypass into my forked repo, but ever since that it completely froze.
So what I decided to do was make another "forked repo" by copying and pasting the code into their files and buffing it with some extra things I call it Now.GG-X.
Credits to CybriaTech, cause without them this wouldn't exist, and the only good now.gg repo woulldn't be here.

Respect.
