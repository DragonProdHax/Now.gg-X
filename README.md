Read everything if you don't have low attention span.

CybriaGG was the first to make a good Now.gg repo that wouldn't be detected via proxy, so I forked it and used it like a lot of other people.
At some point I realized that the creator of that repo archived it, and the repo wasn't working as usual.
I added a bypass into my forked repo, but ever since that it completely froze.
So what I decided to do was make another "forked repo" by copying and pasting the code into their files (cause i already had a fork from them) and buffing it with some extra things I call it Now.GG-X.
Credits to CybriaTech, cause without them this wouldn't exist, and the only good now.gg repo woulldn't be here. 
Also, this is NEW, expect bugs and issues because we are relatively new to this shi.


In shorter terms, I forked CybriaGG's repo and they archived their own repo, so I practically made a newer version of my repo (credits to CybriaGG again,) and you can see it as a combination of CybriaGG and my own stuff. 

If it says "Unsafe Proxy or VPN detected" still, refresh it, that's on us. Sorry.

Apps I know that can deploy this repo: Render. (If you have any more please tell us on Discussions!)
